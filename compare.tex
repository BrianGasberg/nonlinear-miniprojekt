\subsection{Sliding Mode Control vs. Lyapunov Redesign} % (fold)
\label{sub:sliding_mode_control_vs_lyapunov_redesign}
In Appendix \ref{cha:sliding_mode} and Appendix \ref{cha:lyapunov_redesign_results}, plots of simulation results of both
control design via Lyapunov redesign and Sliding mode. Figure \ref{fig:lyap} is depicting the step response of the
simulation results of a Lyapunov redesign control design technique. Figure \ref{fig:smc} is depicting the step response
of the simulation results of a Sliding mode control design technique. Both control designs meets the requirements for the
system.

It can be seen on the figures that the sliding mode controller is faster at reaching the target angle. This comes from the sliding mode being more aggressive
than the Lyaponov redesign controller. When increasing the model uncertainty, it can be seen that the Lyaponov redesign controller still gets the pendulum quite close to the target angle, while the sliding mode controller can not handle the perturbations, although it does pass the target angle.
