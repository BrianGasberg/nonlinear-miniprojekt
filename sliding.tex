\chapter{Sliding Phase}
When the state of the system is finished with its reaching phase, the system enters the sliding phase. The system enters the sliding phase when the system state, on the sliding manifold, (after a coordinate shift) is within $\epsilon$ distance from the equilibrium in origo:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_1x_1 + x_2 < \epsilon
\end{equation}
